# MoonFlow Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-20

MoonFlow is designed with privacy as a top priority. We do not require an account, and we aim to keep your sensitive health data under your control.

---

## 1) What data MoonFlow stores

MoonFlow may store the information you enter in the app, such as:

- Period dates and cycle information  
- Fertility / ovulation-related tracking data  
- Pregnancy mode data (if enabled)  
- Symptoms, mood, and notes you choose to log  
- App settings (e.g., reminders, preferences)

This data is used only to provide the app’s features.

---

## 2) Where your data is stored

MoonFlow stores your tracking data **locally on your device**.

MoonFlow does **not** require a backend account or a MoonFlow server to use core features.

> Note: Your device’s system backup settings (such as iCloud device backups on iOS) may copy some app data as part of a full-device backup. MoonFlow does not control Apple’s or your device’s backup behavior.

---

## 3) Internet connection

MoonFlow does not require an internet connection for core tracking features.

If you choose to access external links (for example, help pages), then an internet connection is needed for those links only.

---

## 4) Account registration

MoonFlow does **not** require account registration.

---

## 5) Ads and tracking

MoonFlow is designed to be **ad-free**.

MoonFlow does not sell your personal data.

---

## 6) In-app purchases (Premium)

MoonFlow may offer optional Premium purchases (subscriptions or lifetime purchase).

Payments are processed by the App Store / Google Play. MoonFlow does not receive your full payment details (such as full card numbers). We may receive purchase status (for example, whether Premium is active) to unlock Premium features on your device.

---

## 7) Third-party services (analytics / crash reports)

MoonFlow is built to work without sharing your health entries with third parties.

MoonFlow does not share your cycle entries, symptoms, mood, or notes with third parties.

If MoonFlow uses any crash reporting or analytics tools in the future, this policy will be updated to describe what is collected and why.

---

## 8) How to delete your data

Because your data is stored locally on your device, you can remove it by:

- Using any in-app delete/reset options (if available), and/or
- Uninstalling MoonFlow from your device

---

## 9) Contact

If you have questions about privacy, contact:
