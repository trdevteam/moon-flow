# MoonFlow Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-20

MoonFlow is designed with privacy as a top priority. We do not require an account, and we aim to keep your sensitive health data under your control.

---

## 1) What data MoonFlow stores

MoonFlow may store the information you enter in the app, such as:

- Period dates and cycle information  
- Fertility / ovulation tracking data  
- Pregnancy mode data (if enabled)  
- Symptoms, mood, and notes you choose to log  
- App settings (for example: reminders, preferences)

This data is used only to provide the app’s features.

---

## 2) Where your data is stored

MoonFlow stores your tracking data **locally on your device**.

MoonFlow does **not** require a backend account or a MoonFlow server to use core features.

> Note: Your device’s system backups (for example, iCloud device backups on iOS) may include app data depending on your device settings. MoonFlow does not control your device backup behavior.

---

## 3) Internet connection

MoonFlow does not require an internet connection for core tracking features.

If you choose to open external links (for example, help pages), internet access is required only for those links.

---

## 4) Account registration

MoonFlow does **not** require account registration.

---

## 5) Ads and tracking

MoonFlow is designed to be **ad-free**.

MoonFlow does not sell your personal data.

---

## 6) In-app purchases (Premium)

MoonFlow may offer optional Premium purchases (subscriptions or a lifetime purchase).

Payments are processed by Apple App Store / Google Play. MoonFlow does not receive your full payment details (such as card numbers). MoonFlow may receive purchase status (for example, whether Premium is active) to unlock Premium features on your device.

---

## 7) Third-party services (analytics / crash reports)

MoonFlow is built to work without sharing your health entries with third parties.

MoonFlow does not share your cycle entries, symptoms, mood, or notes with third parties.

If MoonFlow uses crash reporting or analytics tools in the future, this policy will be updated to describe what is collected and why.

---

## 8) How to delete your data

Because your data is stored locally on your device, you can remove it by:

- Using any in-app delete/reset options (if available), and/or
- Uninstalling MoonFlow from your device

---

## 9) Contact

If you have questions about privacy, contact:

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.
