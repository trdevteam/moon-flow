## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an account?
No. MoonFlow does not require account registration.

### Does MoonFlow need internet?
No for core features. Your cycle tracking works offline. Internet may be needed only for restoring purchases.

### Where is my data stored?
Your health data is stored locally on your device.

### How do I restore purchases?
Open MoonFlow → Premium → Restore Purchases.

### I can’t see subscription options / products won’t load
- Check your internet connection
- Try again after a few minutes (store sync can take time)
- Confirm you’re using the same Apple ID used for TestFlight / purchases
- Try Restore Purchases
If it still fails, email us with your device model and iOS version.

### How does Stealth Mode work?
Stealth Mode can hide the app behind a calculator-style icon. You can open MoonFlow with your PIN.
