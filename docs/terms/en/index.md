These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the MoonFlow mobile application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1) Who we are

MoonFlow is a cycle and pregnancy-related tracking application that helps you record and view personal entries such as symptoms, cycle dates, notes, and related insights. Some features are available only with a paid subscription.

---

## 2) Eligibility

You must be legally able to form a binding contract where you live to use the Service.

If you are using the Service on behalf of someone else or an organization, you represent you have authority to bind them to these Terms.

---

## 3) Medical and health disclaimer (Important)

MoonFlow is an ovulation and cycle tracking tool provided for **informational, educational, and self-tracking purposes only**.

**MoonFlow is not a medical device.** The Service, including any predictions, insights, or notifications, does **not** constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

- **No Professional Advice:** The Service is not a substitute for professional medical judgment. Always seek the advice of a physician or qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or reproductive health.
- **Accuracy of Predictions:** Cycle, ovulation, and pregnancy predictions are estimates based on data you enter. They are not a guarantee of fertility or birth control and should not be used as a primary method of contraception or to facilitate pregnancy without professional guidance.
- **Emergencies:** If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or emergency services immediately. Do not rely on the Service for immediate medical needs.

---

## 4) Your device and safety

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and any authentication method you use (e.g., device passcode, biometric lock, PIN).

### Stealth/Discreet Mode
MoonFlow may provide an optional “Stealth Mode” or similar feature designed to make the app less obvious (for example, appearing as a calculator). You understand:
- This feature reduces casual visibility but **cannot guarantee absolute privacy or safety** in all situations.
- Anyone with access to your device, backups, screenshots, or notifications may still be able to discover app usage or data.
- You are responsible for choosing whether to enable this feature and for managing your PIN/credentials.

---

## 5) License and permitted use

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use.

You agree not to:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where allowed by law.
- Circumvent security, subscriptions, or access controls.
- Use the Service to violate any law, infringe rights, or harm others.
- Disrupt or overload the Service or related systems.

We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms.

## 6) Your content and data (local-only)

“User Content” means information you enter into MoonFlow (for example, cycle events, symptoms, notes, and other entries).

MoonFlow stores your User Content **locally on your device**. We do **not** require an account and we do **not** upload or store your User Content on our servers.

Certain features may require an internet connection for store-related functions (such as subscribing and restoring purchases). Payments and subscription status are handled by the app store/provider you used to download the app, and may be subject to their terms and policies.

If you use export or backup features, you control where your data is saved (for example, device storage or a location you choose). You are responsible for keeping backups safe and remembering any passwords/keys used for backups (if applicable).

For details about how we handle personal data, please review our **Privacy Policy** (linked in the app and on our website).

---

## 7) Subscriptions and billing

MoonFlow may offer auto-renewing subscription plans ("Premium") that unlock additional features.

### Payment and Billing
If you choose to purchase a subscription, payment will be charged to your **Apple ID** or **Google Play** account (your "Store Account") upon confirmation of purchase.

### Auto-Renewal
Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you turn off auto-renewal at least **24 hours before the end of the current period**.
- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the then-current price.
- You will not be notified prior to each recurring charge unless the price increases or the billing period changes.

### Cancellation
You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your **device settings** (e.g., Apple ID Subscriptions or Google Play Subscriptions).
- **Uninstalling the app does not cancel your subscription.** You must cancel it through your Store Account settings.
- If you cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period, after which you will revert to the free version. Refunds are not provided for unused portions of the term, except where required by law.

### Free Trials
If a free trial is offered, you will be charged the full subscription price when the trial ends unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial expires. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

## 8) Third-party services and links

The Service may include third-party libraries or links to external websites. We are not responsible for third-party services, content, or websites. Your use of third-party services may be governed by their own terms and policies.

---

## 9) Intellectual property

The Service, including all software, designs, graphics, logos, and text (excluding User Content), is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service unless we give you written permission.

---

## 10) Feedback

If you submit suggestions, ideas, or feedback, you grant us the right to use it without restriction or compensation, and you confirm it does not contain confidential information.

---

## 11) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time.

We may suspend or terminate your access if:
- you violate these Terms,
- we are required to do so by law, or
- we discontinue the Service.

Termination does not affect rights or obligations that by their nature should survive (e.g., disclaimers, limitation of liability).

---

## 12) Disclaimer of warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not guarantee that:
- the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free,
- predictions/insights will be accurate,
- data will never be lost,
- the Service will meet your requirements.

---

## 13) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

IN ALL CASES, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR USD $50 IF YOU PAID NOTHING (WHICHEVER IS GREATER), UNLESS APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES A DIFFERENT AMOUNT.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.

---

## 14) Indemnity

To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:
- your misuse of the Service,
- your violation of these Terms,
- your violation of any law or third-party rights.

---

## 15) Changes to the Service or Terms

We may modify the Service or these Terms from time to time.

If we make material changes, we will provide notice within the app, on our website, or by another reasonable method. Your continued use after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.

---

## 16) Governing law and disputes

If you have a dispute with us, please contact support first so we can try to resolve it informally.

To the extent permitted by law, these Terms will be governed by the laws applicable in the place where we are established, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.

If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, it will be handled in the courts with jurisdiction where we are established, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

---

## 17) App store terms (platform note)

If you downloaded the Service from a third-party app store, your use may also be subject to that store’s terms and policies. In case of conflict regarding payments, refunds, or subscription management, the store’s rules generally apply.
